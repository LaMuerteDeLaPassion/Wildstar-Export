a tool for exporting Wildstar models into unity.

How to use:
 - Open the main scene in Unity. (Made in Unity 2021.3.4f1)
 - Run the scene
 - Click "Select Wildstar Path" and navigate to the Wildstar.exe file. Select that file.
 - Once the game is loaded, use the navigation menu to find a model you want to view/Export.
 - Click "Export" to export the model. 

Note: Make sure to select only the submeshes you want to export.
Note2: The exported models will be exported as prefabs to your Assets/Resources folder
Note3: Many models do not display correctly. This is usually because the shader is not fully understood.
